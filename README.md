MindYOLO is [MindSpore Lab](https://github.com/mindspore-lab)'s software toolbox that implements state-of-the-art YOLO series algorithms, [support list and benchmark](MODEL_ZOO.md). It is written in Python and powered by the [MindSpore](https://mindspore.cn/) AI framework.

The r0.1 branch supports **MindSpore 1.8.1**.

## Installation

### Dependency

- mindspore >= 1.8.1
- numpy >= 1.17.0
- pyyaml >= 5.3
- openmpi 4.0.3 (for distributed mode)

To install the dependency, please run
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

MindSpore can be easily installed by following the official [instructions](https://www.mindspore.cn/install) where you can select your hardware platform for the best fit. To run in distributed mode, [openmpi](https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v4.0/) is required to install.

The following instructions assume the desired dependency is fulfilled.

⚠️ The current version only supports the Ascend platform, and the GPU platform will be supported later.

## Getting Started

See [GETTING STARTED](GETTING_STARTED.md)

To be supplemented.

## Notes

⚠️ The current version is based on the static shape of GRAPH. The dynamic shape of the PYNATIVE will be added later. Please look forward to it.
